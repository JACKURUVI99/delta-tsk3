### Getting Started - Step by Step Guide

#### Step 1: Starting the Chat Server
Before anyone can chat, you need to start the server:

```bash
# Method 1: Using npm (recommended for beginners)
npm start

# Method 2: Direct Lua command
lua5.3 server.lua

# Method 3: Using Docker (if you have Docker installed)
npm run docker:up
```

You should see:
```
Chat server initialized!
Default room 'general' created
Chat server started on localhost:8888
Waiting for connections...
```

#### Step 2: Connecting as a Client
Open a new terminal window and start a client:

```bash
# Method 1: Using npm
npm run client

# Method 2: Direct Lua command
lua5.3 client.lua
```

You should see:
```

### üöÄ Multiple Users Setup

To test with multiple users on the same computer:

1. **Start the server** (Terminal 1):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open multiple client terminals** (Terminal 2, 3, 4, etc.):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 2
   npm run client
   register user1 pass1
   login user1 pass1
   
   # Terminal 3  
   npm run client
   register user2 pass2
   login user2 pass2
   
   # Terminal 4
   npm run client  
   register user3 pass3
   login user3 pass3
   ```

3. **Start chatting** - messages from one terminal will appear in all others!

### üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Connection refused" Error
```bash
# Make sure server is running first
npm start
# Then in another terminal:
npm run client
```

#### "Command not found: lua" Error
```bash
# Install Lua first:
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install lua5.3 lua-socket

# MacOS:
brew install lua luarocks
luarocks install luasocket
```

#### "Module not found" Error
```bash
# Install luasocket:
luarocks install luasocket
```

#### Forgot Your Password
Unfortunately, there's no password recovery yet. You'll need to:
1. Stop the server
2. Delete the `users.txt` file
3. Restart the server
4. Register again with a new password

### üéØ Tips for Beginners

1. **Always start the server first** before connecting clients
2. **Use simple passwords** for testing (this is just for learning!)
3. **Try multiple terminals** to simulate different users
4. **Use `/help`** if you forget commands
5. **Check `/stats`** to see room activity
6. **Join different rooms** to organize conversations
7. **Use the leaderboard** to see who's most active

### üèÜ Fun Challenges

1. **Race to the Top**: See who can get to #1 on the leaderboard
2. **Room Creator**: Create the most popular chat room
3. **Helper**: Help new users learn the commands
4. **Conversation Starter**: Start interesting discussions in different rooms

## Technical Details

### Server Architecture
- **Socket-based**: Uses Lua's socket library for TCP connections
- **Coroutine threading**: Handles multiple clients with Lua coroutines
- **File-based storage**: Simple text files for data persistence
- **Room system**: Users can create and join different chat rooms

### Security Features
- **Password hashing**: Simple hash function for password storage
- **Authentication required**: Must login before accessing chat
- **Session management**: Tracks authenticated users

### Data Storage
- **users.txt**: Stores username:password_hash pairs
- **Room data**: In-memory storage with file backup
- **Message history**: Stored per room with timestamps

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Run deployment script
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Builds Docker images on every push
2. Runs basic tests
3. Pushes images to Docker Hub
4. Deploys to staging/production

Set up these secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused"**
   - Make sure the server is running
   - Check if port 8888 is available

2. **"Module not found"**
   - Install luasocket: `luarocks install luasocket`

3. **Docker issues**
   - Ensure Docker is running
   - Try: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build`

### Logs
```bash
# View Docker logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View server logs
tail -f server.log
```
